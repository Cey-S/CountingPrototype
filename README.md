# ðŸ§® Counting Prototype ðŸ§®
âœ¨ The goal of the game is to gather all the game objects into the box.  
ðŸŽ® Mouse clicks control the player character by using raycasting.  
ðŸŽ² The ball objects spawn each time randomly, both the counts and positions.  

ðŸ¤” This prototype could be improved by adding a time limit to the game or different objects to the scene that should not be counted inside the box. If the player drops the wrong game object into the box, that object could fly back to its original position, or points could be deducted.
